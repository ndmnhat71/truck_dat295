# A Node declaration starts with 'NODE' and ends with 'ENDNODE'
#
# The coordinates have to be in INTEGER form
#
# The body of the declaration consists of:
#     1. The (x, y)-coordinates for this Node
#     2. A list of (x, y)-coordinates for all Nodes, to which there is an out-edge from this Node
#        The list is either separated by semicolon ';' or by a new line

NODE
    5,3
    4,2 ; 3,5 ; 4,3
ENDNODE

NODE
    # (x, y)-coordinates for this Node:
    3,5
    # Standard format for list of out-edges:
    5,3 ; 4,3
ENDNODE

NODE
    # (x, y)-coordinates for this Node:
    7,8
    # Alternative format for list of out-edges:
    9,10
    11,12
    13,14
ENDNODE
